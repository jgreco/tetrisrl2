Building TetrisRL2 should be very simple, though it assumes a few things:

	- You have Ncurses development stuff installed
	- You have pthreads
	- You have iniparser development stuff installed

Make sure you have each of these installed correctly before you try to proceed.
If you are using a modern Linux system it should be very simple for the most
part, don't worry about pthreads (you will already have it), your package
manager can assist you in getting ncurses, and it might be able to get you
iniparser.  If not, you can download and install iniparser as so:

      wget http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/iniparser3.0b.tar.gz
      tar -xvf iniparser3.0b.tar.gz
      cd iniparser3.0b/
      make

  -then, as root or sudo -
  (exact paths may vary)

      cp src/dictionary.h /usr/local/include
      cp libiniparser.so.0 /usr/lib
      ln -s /usr/lib/libiniparser.so.0 /usr/lib/libiniparser.so
      ldconfig

  - If you do not feel comforable doing this, or do not have permission to do
    so, you may statically link tetrisrl2 with iniparser, but you are on your
    own with doing this.


After you are sure that you have all the required libraries installed, you need
to determine if you want to build TetrisRL2 with or without unicode.

  - With unicode

      make

  - Without unicode

      make -f Makefile.no_utf8


That's it!  Assuming everything worked out fine, you can now simply run
TetrisRL2 like:

  ./tetrisrl2
