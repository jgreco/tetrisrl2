README file for "TetrisRL 2" by John L. Greco

INTRO:
======
TetrisRL 2 is my 2010 7drl Challenge entry, this file, as well as all the files
that came with this do not reflect the actual submitted state of my 7drl, if
you are a purist you may find the original submission either on github, or
linked on TetrisRL 2's webpage.

Similar to the goal of TetRLs it is a highly experimental roguelike with
gameplay stylized after the hit computer game Tetris, created by Alexey
Pajitnov in 1985 while working at the Academy of Science of the USSR.

Unlike TetRLs, TetrisRL 2 is *nix only (no official windows build), realtime,
contains multiple monsters, row elimination, objects, and a more complex
stats/combat system.


BUILDING AND INSTALLATION:
==========================
See the BUILDING file.

Please not that while it may be possible to get this game to run with Cygwin,
the author has not done so and thus cannot support that.


PREMISE:
========

Premise to TetRLs:
------------------
In TetRLs you play an unidentified character who is apparently trapped
in the laboratory of a mad soviet scientist, forced to participate in some
sort of bizarre mind-game experiment that involves a lot of arranging of oddly
shaped crates.  However, you must balance this task with battling dozens of
highly aggressive lab rats that apparently escaped (or were released...).

Premise to TetrisRL2:
---------------------
Once again you play an unidentified character who remains trapped by a mad
soviet scientist.  He has come up with a new experiment, far larger in scale
and more challenging than the last.  This time you must direct the movement of
several large and oddly shaped moving platforms, while battling various lab
animals with whatever supplies you can find laying around.  Platforms are
rigged to explode if you complete a row with them, which can be used to your
advantage (eliminate monsters), or can kill you if you happen to be in the
wrong place.


GAMEPLAY:
=========
TetrisRL 2 once again uses very simple controls which can be learned quickly.
Movement can be done with standard "vi-keys", "wasd", "arrow keys, or the
numpad with 'numlock' turned on. You may choose to use whichever scheme you wish
at any time though use of the arrow keys is discouraged because that scheme does
not provide easy access to diagonal movement keys.

TetrisRL 2 uses a modal input scheme (think Vi).  To toggle back and forth
between controlling the @-guy and controlling where the tetrominos fall, press
the spacebar.  The screen will indicate at all times which mode you are in.

To complete the game, the player must manage to not fall off the tetrominos,
stack several of them up so that they reach the top of the level, and make
his way up to the top.  Each tetromino will be spawned with a random assortment
of monsters (the difficulty of tetrominos will increase over the course of the
game), as well as a single item to help the player (A med-pack, weapon, or
piece of armor).  To pickup/use items simply bump into them.  There is no
inventory system.
